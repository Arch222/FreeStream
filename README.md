# FreeStream
A Decentralized Streaming Application built using Livepeer, Textile, and Unlock
Our goal was to build a decentralized streaming application that takes advantage of the aforementioned technolgies to give more power to content-creators. 
Specific Details:
FreeStream is an application built on all three ofthese platforms. It uses LivePeer to power its streaming services and allow content creators to sharecontent with anyone who has an internet connection. Individuals and organizations that use FreeStream can take advantage of Unlockâ€™s capabilities, which is seamlessly integrated intot he main streaming platform, to restrict content. Furthermore, FreeStream takes advantage of Textile(and to a lesser extent, Filecoin) by leveraging their storage to allow users to upload any files they want. Finally, all of FreeStream is hosted through Textile.
