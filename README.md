# FreeStream
A Decentralized Streaming Application built using Livepeer, Textile, and Unlock
Our goal was to build a decentralized streaming application that takes advantage of the aforementioned technolgies to give more power to content-creators. 
Specific Details:
FreeStream is an application built on all three ofthese platforms. It uses LivePeer to power itsstreaming services and allow content creators to sharecontent with anyone who has an internetconnection. Individuals and organizations that useFreeStream can take advantage of Unlockâ€™scapabilities, which is seamlessly integrated intothe main streaming platform, to restrict content.Furthermore, FreeStream takes advantage of Textile(andto a lesser extent, Filecoin) byleveraging their storage to allow users to uploadany files they want. Finally, all of FreeStream ishosted through Textile.
